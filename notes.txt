How on earth is the foxel data sent to the GPU?

As-is:
0                 : BrickPtr(u16)[TOTAL_BRICK_COUNT]
TREE_BRICKS_BYTES : Foxel[BRICK_SIZE][TOTAL_BRICK_COUNT]

BrickPtrs are 2 bytes.
- If the high-bit is set, then it's a 15-bit (or less) brick index.
- Otherwise, the low 8 bits express a solid brick of that foxel.

Cool theory ideas:
0                 : BrickPtr(u8)[TOTAL_BRICK_COUNT]
TREE_BRICKS_BYTES : Foxel[BRICK_SIZE][256]

BrickPtrs are 1 byte.
- No special solidity checks. But, brick #0 is always all-air.
- This means we can only ship 255 unique bricks to the GPU; the hope is that we
  don't need that many (because we can cull things we don't care for.)
  That's still a lot of space!
