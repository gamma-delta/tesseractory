How on earth is the foxel data sent to the GPU?

As-is:
0                 : BrickPtr(u16)[TOTAL_BRICK_COUNT]
TREE_BRICKS_BYTES : Foxel[BRICK_SIZE][TOTAL_BRICK_COUNT]

BrickPtrs are 2 bytes.
- If the high-bit is set, then it's a 15-bit (or less) brick index.
- Otherwise, the low 8 bits express a solid brick of that foxel.
